          We started Verbena because we wanted to transform the way women engage
          and interact with their personal physician in a safe, accessible and
          convenient way. We wanted to create a seamless, modern, fully
          integrated solution that empowers women to take charge of their sexual
          health—from menstruation to menopause—in partnership with their
          trusted physician. Verbena is healthcare her way. Verbena is
          healthcare your way.
