                    women engage and interact with their personal physician in a
                    safe, accessible and convenient way. We wanted to create a
                    seamless, modern, fully integrated solution that empowers
                    women to take charge of their sexual health—from
                    menstruation to menopause—in partnership with their trusted
                    physician. Verbena is healthcare her way. Verbena is
                    healthcare your way.”
